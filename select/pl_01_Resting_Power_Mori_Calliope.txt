Started like a whisper,
but grew as I flew
At times, I almost miss her.
Just do as I do
We can't lose, it's confusing,
but I need you to trust me
She's plugging up her ears
in pure rebellion, it must be
Fear of contradicting,
a life in the un-living
A voice of vitriol,
pissed at y'all, yet forgiving
Even so,
I fail just to walk toward
Her nails on a chalkboard
Swing the scythe,
but she talks. Back.
With a bright chord.
Leaks out from time to time,
Shouts loud and speaks her mind
Clout chasing?
More like racing the clock
Of modern minds
Leaving us behind,
just step back, sure you'll find
With the two of us in tandem
I will not let us die
So let's try
To stand against the odds
They can call us anything like
Bitches, cowards, frauds
…but WE'RE the ones
who get heard,
then we reap the applause
It's deeper than
identity crisis,
like this because…
It's a lifestyle, ain't it?
Wanna sketch it out first,
the crowd says paint it,
but always
Eggshells walking over any vibe
I'm sending
Ain't you ever
sick of pretending?
So I'll take a solid look
in the mirror
Should I give her all of it,
should I fear her?
Here and
Now you're,
Part of me
Resting power,
heart of free soul
Stand against time,
Put your
Hand in mine
Here and
Now you're,
Part of me, every
Hour, feels like the beginning.
A transient shield,
she's what the real me
could never be
Plans to get that gold,
never get old, "remember me"
Says it every time,
like she knows
it's only temporary
Bird brained and clumsy,
she numbs me, Yet she beCOMES me
Nobody ever really SEES
the difference
Bloodied up
and leaning sideways,
she closes distance,
rinse, repeat, defeat,
Convince, get beat, delete
Mince words, and take heat,
wincing, hurting,
hit the streets
birds of a feather
flock together,
here we are again
She and I see eye to eye
but can't help set the bar again
…So tell me just how far
we gonna take this?
Work until the fires
of the clientele break us?
You smile well,
reside in hell and never give in
But maybe I can't survive
an environment like this
Tired and anxious, her advice is
"We are their light, sis."
And so I fight this.
The brightness, in my crisis,
she saved my fuckin life,
risk it all
It's a lifestyle, ain't it?
She finds a way to cleanse
our soiled rep
when I stain it, but always
Eggshells walking over any vibe
I'm sending
Ain't you ever
sick of pretending?
So I'll take a solid look
in the mirror
Should I give her all of it,
should I fear her?
Here and
Now you're,
Part of me
Resting power,
heart of free soul
Stand against time,
Put your
Hand in mine
Here and
Now you're,
Part of me, every
Hour, feels like the beginning.
It feels like the beginning.
It's nothing like the beginning.
I think we just might
be winning.
I'm thinking you must
be kidding.
It feels like the beginning.
But I'm really thinking you and
I could start something new.
